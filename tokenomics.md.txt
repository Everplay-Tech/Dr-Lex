# FUTURE FOUNDATION  
## INTERNAL CURRENCY AND TREASURY POLICY  
### ($LEX Closed-Economy Specification)

---

### ARTICLE I — PURPOSE AND SCOPE
1. The Foundation establishes an internal unit of account known as **“$LEX”** (“Lex Token”) for use exclusively within Foundation programs and affiliated research environments.  
2. $LEX shall function as a closed, non-transferable medium of record representing value, contribution, and governance weight in internal operations.  
3. The $LEX system is **not a public currency or security** and may not be sold, traded, or offered to the general public without explicit Board authorization and compliance review.

---

### ARTICLE II — ISSUANCE AND SUPPLY
1. **Total Authorized Supply:** 100,000,000 $LEX units.  
2. **Initial Mint:** 10,000,000 $LEX to be held in the **Foundation Treasury Account** for allocation under Article III.  
3. **Minting Authority:** The Board of Trustees, acting through the Treasurer, may mint or burn tokens only upon documented resolution.  
4. **Audit Trail:** All mints, burns, and transfers must be recorded in the **Treasury Ledger** located at `/data/treasury/ledger.json` and mirrored to `/archive/` monthly.

---

### ARTICLE III — ALLOCATION POLICY
| Allocation Category | Percentage of Initial Mint | Description |
|---------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| **Treasury Reserve** | 40 % | Liquidity buffer and long-term sustainability fund. |
| **Research & Development** | 25 % | Grants for technical innovation, AI ethics research, and Containment-Chain modules. |
| **Impact & Empathy Projects** | 20 % | Programs that directly reduce suffering or increase access; approved by the Ethics Committee. |
| **Operational Runway** | 10 % | Salaries, administration, and compliance. |
| **Wisdom Credits Pool** | 5 % | Incentives and acknowledgments for human contributions, defined in `/docs/root-system-plan.md`. |

All allocations are subject to quarterly review and may be rebalanced by Board vote.

---

### ARTICLE IV — GOVERNANCE AND VOTING
1. Each Trustee wallet and approved research division is assigned **non-transferable governance $LEX** tokens.  
2. One (1) governance $LEX equals one (1) vote within internal DAO-style polls conducted on the Foundation’s private network.  
3. Major actions—minting, burning, allocation above 1 % of supply, or external licensing—require a two-thirds (⅔) supermajority.  
4. Minor operational votes require a simple majority.

---

### ARTICLE V — TREASURY MECHANICS
1. The Treasury shall maintain a **multi-signature governance wallet** requiring not fewer than two (2) human Trustees and one (1) AI verification node (Dr Lex) to co-sign transactions.  
2. Dr Lex may generate and verify transaction data but cannot unilaterally execute transfers.  
3. Monthly reconciliations are reviewed by the Finance & Treasury Committee and archived with SHA-256 checksums.  
4. External audits shall be commissioned at least annually.

---

### ARTICLE VI — EMPATHY AND WISDOM METRICS
1. Allocation of funds and token rewards shall align with the **Empathy Index (EI)** and **Wisdom Score (WC)** defined in the Dr Lex documentation.  
2. Projects achieving EI ≥ 0.75 and WC ≥ 0.7 qualify for enhanced funding multipliers of up to 1.2× baseline.  
3. Metrics are recorded in `/data/metrics.json` and incorporated into quarterly Board reports.

---

### ARTICLE VII — COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING
1. The Foundation shall maintain detailed books of account in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and applicable Illinois statutes.  
2. Annual financial statements shall include:
   - Total $LEX minted and burned  
   - Outstanding balances by allocation category  
   - Summary of EI and WC multipliers applied  
3. These statements will be published to Trustees and archived internally; limited summaries may be released publicly at the Board’s discretion.
