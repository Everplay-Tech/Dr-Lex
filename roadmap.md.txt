## V. PRODUCTIVITY PROTOCOLS
1. **Version Discipline** – semantic versioning; archive signed zips each phase.  
2. **Automated Logging** – Dr Lex bots append metrics nightly.  
3. **Immutable Snapshots** – `/archive/` stores SHA-signed releases.  
4. **Human Approval Gates** – all merges require two human signatures.  
5. **Focus Blocks** – two 90-minute uninterrupted sessions daily.  
6. **Empathy Review** – weekly reflection on social and ethical impact.
